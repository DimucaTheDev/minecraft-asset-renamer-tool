# Minecraft Asset Renamer
## About
Renames Minecraft assets(sounds etc) back to their human-readable names.

## How To Use
Simply paste version's JSON file path. For example:
```
C:\Users\username\AppData\.minecraft\versions\1.20.2\1.20.2.json
```

By default this utility will copy files to "output" folder, but you can change name or path by passing an argument, like this:
```powershell
./MinecraftAssetRenamer.exe C:\Assets
```
As a result this program will copy all game assets to the folder `Assets`, saving their file and folder structure.
