# Minecraft Asset Renamer
Renames Minecraft assets(sounds etc) back to their normal names.

# How To Use
Simply paste version's JSON file path. For example - C:\Users\username\AppData\.minecraft\versions\1.20.2\1.20.2.json

By default this utility will copy files to "output" folder, but you can change name or path by passing an argument, like this:
```powershell
./MinecraftAssetRenamer.exe C:\Assets
```
